Hello, 
I have some friends who have apply or are applying for this study permit, and sometimes it may be hard to provide a letter for to prove their financial capacity. 
I provide a template that may help you get started

As outlined from [paragraph 2 from section 11 of I-0.2.1, r. 3 - Québec Immigration Regulation](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/version/cr/I-0.2.1%2C%20r.%203?code=se%3A11&history=20241030&utm_source=chatgpt.com).
> ## Section 11 - Minister's Consent for International Student Program

I am by no means an immigration lawyer, so please consult your own lawyers for this process.
I am a software engineer, and I simply wish to increase the documentation on this matter slightly. 

You are liable for your own application, so please do your own research and write it yourself.
